# FCS Agent Flow Transition Design Document
## From RAG Chat to Cognitive Expression System

### Executive Summary

This document outlines the transition from the current MemDuo RAG-based chat system to a sophisticated agent flow architecture that implements the FCS (Fischman-Gardener System) expression layer. The new system will enable proactive cognitive interactions, contradiction detection, concept tracking, and memory-assisted learning while maintaining the core FGM principles of fluid processing and mutual intelligence adaptation.

## 1. Current System Analysis

### 1.1 Existing Architecture
**Frontend (Chat.tsx)**
- Simple message exchange interface
- Static query mode selection (normal/graph/combined)
- Basic markdown rendering with image/source support
- Immediate user input processing

**Backend (api/chat.py + rag_service.py)**
- Session-based chat management
- RAGService with user-specific retrieval
- Memory storage via FCSMemoryService
- Static prompt templates
- Reactive response generation

**Memory System**
- FCSMemoryService with search capabilities
- User-specific memory isolation
- Simple fact storage and retrieval
- No salience tracking or contradiction detection

### 1.2 Current Limitations
- **Reactive Only**: System only responds when prompted
- **No Expression Logic**: Cannot initiate conversations or observations
- **Limited Context Awareness**: No cross-session concept tracking
- **Static Interaction**: No adaptive behavior based on user patterns
- **No Contradiction Detection**: Cannot identify conflicting beliefs
- **Missing Salience Management**: No weighted importance of memories

### 2.2 Agent Flow Workflow

```

                                    ├─ Memory Analysis Agent
                                    ├─ Concept Tracking Agent
                                    ├─ RAG Retrieval Agent
                                    └─ Response Generation Agent

                        ├─ Standard Response
                        ├─ Contradiction Alert
                        ├─ Concept Tracking Suggestion
                        └─ Reflective Expression
```

## 3. FCS Expression Layer Design

### 3.1 Expression Trigger Logic Implementation

**Based on FCS Math & Logic Reference:**
- **Expression Threshold Logic**: `should_express = true` only when trigger conditions are met
- **Trigger Types**:
  1. **Contradiction Detection**: High-salience conflicts with prior statements
  2. **Concept Evolution**: Recurring themes reaching tracking threshold
  3. **Reflection Opportunities**: Prior high-salience ideas connecting to current input
  4. **Clarification Needs**: Ambiguous or incomplete user expressions

**Expression Decision Matrix:**
```
Salience Score > 0.4 AND (
  Contradiction_Detected OR
  Concept_Frequency > 3 OR
  Reflection_Opportunity_Score > 0.6 OR
  Clarification_Confidence < 0.3
) → should_express = true
```

### 3.2 Expression Templates

**Contradiction Expression:**
> "I notice something interesting here. You mentioned {prior_belief} before, but this seems to suggest {current_implication}. Want to explore this tension?"

**Concept Tracking Expression:**
> "I've noticed you've been exploring {concept_name} across our conversations. Would you like me to help track how your thinking about this evolves?"

**Reflective Expression:**
> "You know, you once said that {prior_high_salience_statement}... This feels connected to what you're sharing now. Shall we look at how your perspective might be shifting?"

**Clarification Expression:**
> "I want to make sure I understand correctly. When you say {ambiguous_statement}, are you referring to {interpretation_a} or {interpretation_b}?"

### 3.3 Salience Management System

**Salience Calculation Factors:**
- **Recency**: Recent memories have higher base salience
- **Frequency**: Repeated concepts gain salience over time
- **Emotional Intensity**: User expressions with strong sentiment
- **Contradiction Weight**: Conflicting information increases salience
- **User Engagement**: Active user responses boost associated memory salience

**Salience Decay Model:**
```
salience(t) = base_salience * e^(-decay_rate * time_since_creation) * reinforcement_factor
```

## 4. Agent Flow Integration Strategy

### 4.1 LlamaIndex Agent Flow Implementation

**Workflow Definition:**
```python
# Conceptual workflow structure
class FCSExpressionWorkflow:
    @step
    async def analyze_input(self, user_message: UserMessage) -> AnalysisResult
    
    @step  
    async def check_contradictions(self, analysis: AnalysisResult) -> ContradictionCheck
    
    @step
    async def evaluate_concepts(self, analysis: AnalysisResult) -> ConceptEvaluation
    
    @step
    async def retrieve_context(self, analysis: AnalysisResult) -> RetrievalResult
    
    @step
    async def decide_expression(self, 
                               contradiction: ContradictionCheck,
                               concepts: ConceptEvaluation,
                               context: RetrievalResult) -> ExpressionDecision
    
    @step
    async def generate_response(self, decision: ExpressionDecision) -> FinalResponse
```

**Agent Coordination:**
- **Event-Driven Communication**: Agents communicate via structured events
- **Shared Memory Context**: All agents access unified memory graph
- **Parallel Processing**: Independent agent operations run concurrently
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Graceful degradation when agents fail

### 4.2 Memory Graph Enhancement

**Graph Structure Evolution:**
```
Current: User → Messages → Facts
Enhanced: User → Sessions → Messages → Facts → Concepts → Contradictions
                     ↓         ↓        ↓         ↓
                  Salience  Timestamps Relationships Tracking_Status
```

**New Relationship Types:**
- `CONTRADICTS`: Between conflicting facts
- `REINFORCES`: Between supporting facts
- `EVOLVES_TO`: Concept development chains
- `TRIGGERS_EXPRESSION`: High-salience connections
- `TRACKS_CONCEPT`: User-approved concept monitoring

**System Expression Indicators:**
- **Subtle Animation**: Brain icon pulses when system has something to express
- **Expression Bubbles**: Gentle, non-intrusive expression delivery

**Interaction Patterns:**
- **Conversational Flow**: Expressions integrate naturally into dialogue

**Phase 2: Concept Tracking**

## 10. Conclusion

This transition represents a fundamental evolution from reactive chat to proactive cognitive partnership. By implementing the FCS expression layer through LlamaIndex agent flows, we create a system that embodies the FGM principles of fluid intelligence, continuous adaptation, and mutual learning enhancement.

The agent flow architecture provides the flexibility to implement sophisticated expression logic while maintaining system reliability and user control. The phased implementation approach ensures manageable complexity while delivering immediate value through contradiction detection and concept tracking.

Success will be measured not just by technical performance, but by the system's ability to genuinely enhance human cognitive processes through thoughtful, well-timed expressions that deepen understanding and facilitate learning.
