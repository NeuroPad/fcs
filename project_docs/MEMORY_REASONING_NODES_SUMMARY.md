# Memory-based Reasoning Nodes in Normal Mode

## Overview

The normal RAG mode has been enhanced to automatically extract and display **reasoning nodes** from FCS memory facts. This provides transparency into which memory nodes influenced the AI's response, without requiring any mode changes.

## âœ¨ Key Enhancement

**Before**: Normal mode returned only answers and sources  
**After**: Normal mode also returns reasoning nodes from memory facts with salience and confidence scoring

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### RAG Service Changes (`services/rag_service.py`)

1. **Memory Processing Enhancement**:
   - Increased memory fact retrieval from 3 to 5 facts for better node coverage
   - Added reasoning node conversion for each memory fact retrieved
   - Implemented salience and confidence calculation algorithms

2. **New Helper Methods**:
   ```python
   def _calculate_memory_salience(self, memory_fact: Dict[str, Any]) -> float
   def _calculate_memory_confidence(self, memory_fact: Dict[str, Any]) -> float
   ```

3. **Response Enhancement**:
   - Normal mode now returns `reasoning_nodes` array populated with memory nodes
   - Each memory fact becomes a `ReasoningNode` with full metadata

### Reasoning Node Structure

Each memory fact is converted to a reasoning node with:

```python
ReasoningNode(
    uuid=fact['uuid'],                    # Memory fact UUID
    name=fact['name'] or fact['fact'][:50], # Short display name
    salience=calculated_salience,         # Importance score (0.1-1.0)
    confidence=calculated_confidence,     # Reliability score (0.1-1.0)
    summary=fact['fact'],                # Full memory content
    node_type="memory",                  # Always "memory" for FCS facts
    used_in_context="memory_retrieval"   # How it was used
)
```

## ðŸ“Š Scoring Algorithms

### Salience Calculation
- **Base score**: 0.5
- **Recency boost**: More recent memories score higher (365-day decay)
- **Validity boost**: +0.3 for valid, non-invalidated facts
- **Detail boost**: +0.1 for facts longer than 100 characters
- **Range**: 0.1 to 1.0

### Confidence Calculation  
- **Base score**: 0.7
- **Validity boost**: +0.2 for explicitly valid facts
- **Expiration penalty**: -0.3 for expired facts
- **Completeness boost**: +0.1 for well-sized facts (50-500 chars)
- **Range**: 0.1 to 1.0

## ðŸ”„ User Experience Flow

1. **User Query**: Sends message with default `mode=normal`
2. **Memory Retrieval**: FCS memory service searches for relevant facts
3. **Node Conversion**: Each memory fact becomes a reasoning node
4. **Score Calculation**: Salience and confidence computed automatically
5. **Response**: Answer + sources + reasoning_nodes returned
6. **Frontend Display**: ReasoningNodes component shows memory transparency

## ðŸ’¡ Benefits

- **Zero Configuration**: Works with existing normal mode calls
- **Memory Transparency**: Users see which memories influenced responses
- **Trust Indicators**: Confidence scores help users gauge reliability
- **Historical Tracking**: Salience shows memory relevance over time
- **No Breaking Changes**: Existing code continues to work unchanged

## ðŸ§ª Testing

The implementation includes comprehensive testing:

```bash
python test_memory_reasoning_nodes.py
```

Tests cover:
- Memory fact to reasoning node conversion
- Salience and confidence calculation
- Edge cases (minimal data, expired facts)
- Integration demonstration

## ðŸŽ¯ Result

**Normal mode now provides complete reasoning transparency** by converting FCS memory facts into beautifully displayed reasoning nodes with calculated importance and reliability scores.

Users can see exactly which memories the AI used, how important they were (salience), and how much to trust them (confidence) - all without changing any existing code or modes.
