## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Backend API
```bash

curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/chat/session/1/ask?mode=graph" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "Tell me about climate change"}'
```

### Response Format
```json
{
  "answer": "Climate change refers to long-term shifts...",
  "sources": ["climate_report.pdf"],
  "memory_facts": "Retrieved 3 memory facts about climate",
  "reasoning_nodes": [
    {
      "uuid": "climate-node-123",
      "name": "Global Temperature Rise",
      "salience": 0.95,
      "confidence": 0.88,
      "summary": "Data showing global temperature increases...",
      "node_type": "concept",
      "used_in_context": "direct_match, semantic_similarity"
    }
  ]
}
```

## 🎨 Frontend Features

### Beautiful UI Components
- **📊 Expandable Cards** - Clean, modern design with expand/collapse
- **🎯 Node Rankings** - Sorted by salience (most important first)
- **📈 Progress Bars** - Visual representation of salience/confidence
- **🎨 Color Coding** - Green (high), Yellow (medium), Red (low) confidence
- **📱 Responsive** - Perfect on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **🌙 Dark Mode** - Automatic dark theme support

### User Experience
- **⚡ Interactive** - Click nodes to see detailed information
- **🔍 Progressive** - Summary stats + detailed view on demand
- **♿ Accessible** - WCAG compliant with proper ARIA labels
- **🎯 Contextual** - Shows how each node was used in reasoning

## 💾 Data Persistence

### Database Storage
```sql
-- New column in chat_messages table
ALTER TABLE chat_messages ADD COLUMN nodes_referenced TEXT;

-- Example stored JSON data
{
  "nodes_referenced": [
    {
      "uuid": "node-123",
      "name": "Climate Science",
      "salience": 0.9,
      "confidence": 0.85,
      "summary": "Scientific consensus on climate change",
      "node_type": "concept",
      "used_in_context": "direct_match"
    }
  ]
}
```

## 🔧 Query Modes Available

### 1. Normal Mode (`mode=normal`)
- Traditional RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
- No node tracking
- Returns `reasoning_nodes: []`

### 2. Graph Mode (`mode=graph`) 
- Knowledge graph search with full node tracking
- Contradiction-aware search
- Returns detailed reasoning nodes
- **This is where the magic happens!** ✨

### 3. Combined Mode (`mode=combined`)
- Both RAG and graph search
- Best of both worlds
- Returns nodes from graph portion
